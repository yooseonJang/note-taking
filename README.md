# note-taking 
Sooo did you check out my calendar yet ðŸ“… https://yooseonjang.github.io/calendar/?

Well, that was supposed to be incorporated in this website that I was creating for school. Some might argue that pretty notes and organized notes are useless and unnecessary but I beg to differ. I like my notes in one place and organized so that I can refresh my memory without having to look through the entire course lectures and textbooks. Because learning isn't about the school year it should be ready to be recalled when in need outside of school as well in my opinion. And having a nice organized notes really does make me feel accomplished that I was diligent throughout the year! Going off of that idea, I thought it would be a fun idea to create a personal note archive website using HTML, CSS, and JS to challenge my knowledge back in 2021 summer. Although unfinshed, I think I might work on it this summer and maybe it can be a sort of time capsule of how much work I put into finding something I'm passinate about :))
